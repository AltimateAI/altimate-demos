  - name: base_public_user
    description: "The 'base_public_user' model is a simplified and renamed version
      of the original 'user' table from the 'postgres' database. It includes
      four key fields: 'user_id', 'username', 'email', and 'created_at'.
      'user_id' is a unique identifier for each user. 'username' is the chosen
      name of the user. 'email' is the email address associated with the user.
      'created_at' is the timestamp indicating when the user was created. This
      model is designed to provide a clear and concise view of user data for
      business users."
