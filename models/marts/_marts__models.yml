models:
  - name: daily_user_kpi
    description: "The 'daily_user_kpi' model provides a daily summary of user
      activities. It includes three columns: 'day', 'user_id', and
      'number_of_activities'. The 'day' column represents the date of the
      activity. The 'user_id' column is a unique identifier for each user. The
      'number_of_activities' column shows the total number of activities
      performed by a user on a particular day. This model is built by joining
      the 'base_public_activity' and 'base_public_user' tables from the
      'postgresDB' database. It is useful for tracking user engagement and
      activity patterns over time."
