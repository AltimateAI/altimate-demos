models:
  - name: users
    description: The 'users' model is a comprehensive view of user data, combining
      information from both the 'salesforce_users' and 'postgres_user' tables.
      It is designed to provide a holistic view of user data, including user_id
      and email, which are common to both sources. This model is particularly
      useful for business users who need to analyze user behavior and trends
      across different platforms. The data is updated daily, ensuring that the
      most recent user information is always available for analysis.
    columns:
      - name: user_id

          integer value and is automatically generated when a new user is

          and databases.
