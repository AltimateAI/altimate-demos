## Topic dbt model update using natural language:

- Use the marts user, but at least 5 staging layer tables as source
- Have Datapilot explain one specific CTE
- Change other pieces of the code, more specifically, explore:
    - Add two new columns that would do count ifs
        1. Could you please add 3 more columns, to count each activity type (login, logout, post)?
    - Generate a jinja for loop
        1. Could you modify it using jinja for loop, make sure that there is no comma in the end of the for loop?
        2. Could you please add these three new columns to my final CTE using jinja for lopp?
